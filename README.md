# Barbara McDowell and Gerald S. Hartman Foundation grants data

This is for https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations

Specific issue: https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/issues/24

- `scrape.py` scrapes the grants page and writes to `data.csv`. This only needs
  to be done if there is new data on the grants page.
- `proc.py` uses `data.csv` to print out the SQL insert lines.
